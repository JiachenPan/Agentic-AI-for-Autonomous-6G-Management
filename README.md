# Agentic-AI-for-Autonomous-6G-Management
This is an on-premises, LLM-in-the-loop control plane that dynamically splits a 400 MHz unlicensed spectrum budget between 6G NR-U and Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be) in a 60,000-seat stadium. We fine-tune two locally hosted models (Qwen3-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B) on two datasets (Rice RENEW Drone and Zenodo FCB) using LoRA.
