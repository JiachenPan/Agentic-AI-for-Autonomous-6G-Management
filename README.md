# Agentic-AI-for-Autonomous-6G-Management
This is an on-premises, LLM-in-the-loop control plane that dynamically splits a 400 MHz unlicensed spectrum budget between 6G NR-U and Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be) in a 60,000-seat stadium. We fine-tune two locally hosted models (Qwen3-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B) on two datasets (Rice RENEW Drone and Zenodo FCB) using LoRA.
Since files larger than 25MB cannot be uploaded, the LLM base and lora files cannot be uploaded. The local images are shown in the figure. However, after downloading the base, the same fine-tuned LLM can be obtained by using the uploaded python code.
