Rationale: The current spectrum allocation is heavily favoring 5G with 305MHz allocated, while Wi-Fi has only 95MHz. Given the poor SNR and high channel utilization, optimizing 400MHz total spectrum would involve rebalancing the allocation between 5G and Wi-Fi to better utilize available resources and improve overall network performance.

The high SNR indicates excellent signal quality, and the medium channel utilization suggests that the network is not over-saturated, but there might be opportunities to offload some traffic to Wi-Fi to reduce the load on the 5G network. The AoA analysis shows that there are multiple directions to optimize, which could help in better managing the network performance under varying conditions like hot weather.

In foggy weather, the SNR is lower, which means the signal quality is affected. The lower SNR can lead to higher channel utilization as more users are trying to connect with weaker signals, but in this case, the channel utilization is already low, so it might be due to the limited spectrum. The foggy weather also affects the propagation, which can lead to more interference and less efficient use of the available spectrum.

Rationale: The current spectrum allocation is fully utilized with 5G and Wi-Fi each using 100% of their allocated frequencies. However, the high channel utilization suggests that the network is operating near capacity, which may lead to congestion during peak times. The cold weather conditions are affecting the propagation, which could impact the reliability of the network. To optimize, we should consider reallocating some spectrum from 5G to Wi-Fi or exploring additional frequency bands to offload traffic and reduce congestion.

Rationale: The stadium's network requires a balance between 5G and Wi-Fi coverage to handle both high and moderate user activities efficiently. Allocating 300 MHz to 5G ensures high-speed connectivity for a large number of users, while 100 MHz for Wi-Fi provides sufficient bandwidth for additional devices and lower priority activities. The angular dynamics are moderate, with 4 directions tracked, and a moderate SNR of 20 dB ensures reliable connections. Channel utilization is at 15%, indicating that there is potential for optimization without significant disruption to current services.

Rationale: The stadium has a high density of users, so allocating 75% of the bandwidth to 5G ensures higher capacity for the moderate activity level. The remaining 25% is allocated to Wi-Fi for users with lower data needs. The AoA tracking shows low angular dynamics, meaning users are concentrated in specific areas, allowing for more efficient channel utilization. The SNR of 20 dB is sufficient for stable connections, and the channel utilization is 15%, which is acceptable for the current load.

Rationale: This configuration balances 5G and Wi-Fi with equal MHz allocation and moderate channel utilization, ensuring sufficient capacity for temporal optimization while considering seasonal variations.

I need to optimize the network for both 5G and Wi-Fi, considering the given scenario. The stadium has 60,000 people, which is a large venue, so capacity is crucial. The user mentioned temporal network analysis, which suggests that the network usage varies over time and is influenced by seasonal factors. They also noted that the current allocation is insufficient","5G_MHz=
